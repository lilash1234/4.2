How a Lawsuit Progresses: Discovery
Trials in the United States are not conducted by ambush. Before the trial, the parties engage in a mandatory process of mutual disclosure of all relevant documents and other evidence. This court-supervised process of gathering evidence is called discovery. Under procedural rules that govern discovery, the parties must provide to each other lists of witnesses, all relevant documents, tangible evidence, and statements related to the case. Under the old discovery rules, the expense and difficulty of discovery techniques often meant that the search for the truth was a cat-and-mouse game won by those with the most funds. Armed with the evidence from a full-disclosure approach, the parties to a case are more prepared—and perhaps more inclined—to negotiate a settlement. Discovery rules provide for sanctions (penalties) for not turning over relevant documents at the start of a case. Sanctions can include fines against the party who withheld the evidence, findings of contempt against the lawyers (including fines), and the exclusion of responses to the withheld evidence. The following sections cover the traditional tools of discovery.
Requests for Admissions and Interrogatories
A request for admissions asks the other side to admit a certain fact. Interrogatories ask questions about facts. The parties have some incentive to admit the facts requested if they are true because if these facts are denied and then proved at trial, the party who had to prove those true facts can recover the costs of proof. Requests for admissions ask the other party to admit that a document is authentic. For example, the parties might have a dispute about the amount due under a contract but should be willing to admit that they signed the contract and that it is authentic. These requests for admission reduce the length of trials.
Depositions
Depositions are the oral testimony of parties or witnesses that are taken under oath but outside the courtroom and before the trial. They can be taken long before a trial and help preserve a witness’s or party’s recollection. Depositions are also helpful in determining just how strong a case is. It is far better to discover damaging information in a deposition than to have surprises at trial.
Requests for Production
A request for production requires the other side to produce requested documents. For example, if a business is suing to recover lost profits, the defendant will probably want to request the income statements and perhaps the income tax returns of that business in order to prepare for the presentation of damages issues at trial. A request for production can include medical records as well as tangible evidence. Parties must take steps to preserve evidence related to the case and will be sanctioned by the court if they destroy relevant evidence once they are aware of the dispute or the suit is filed. In Delmur Inc. v School Construction Authority (Case 4.2), the destruction of physical evidence is an issue in a case that provides an answer to the opening “Consider … ”

Case 4.2
A Truck Disappeared in Brooklyn
Delmur, Inc. v School Construction Authority
106 N.Y.S.3d 146 (A.D. 2019)
Facts
On October 26, 2009, a truck owned by Delmur, Inc. was allegedly damaged when it was struck by a truck owned by School Construction Authority (SCA). Delmur filed suit against SCA to recover for property damage. On August 31, 2011, SCA served Delmur with a demand for inspection of the truck as well as a demand to preserve evidence, including providing the current location of the truck. Despite repeated demands by SCA to inspect the truck, Delmur did not permit inspection. In 2014, SCA made a specific demand for disclosure of the current location of the truck and the opportunity to inspect, appraise, and photograph the truck. There were some assurances that the truck was still in storage in Brooklyn, but Delmur lawyers did not cooperate with allowing for the requested inspection.
Just before trial, the lawyer for Delmur disclosed to the court on March 3, 2016, that Delmur had ceased its operations. As a result, the owner of the yard where the truck had been stored had “seized and disposed” of the truck in order to pay the years of storage costs for the vehicle. SCA asked the court to dismiss the suit because the issue of the amount of damages to the truck could now never be determined. The trial court denied SCA’s motion to strike the complaint in the suit. SCA appealed.
Judicial Opinion
LEVANTHAL, Judge, et al..
“‘Under the common-law doctrine of spoliation, when a party negligently loses or intentionally destroys key evidence, the responsible party may be sanctioned.
“‘[T]he Supreme Court has broad discretion in determining what, if any, sanction should be imposed for spoliation of evidence’ and may, ‘under appropriate circumstances, impose a sanction even if the destruction occurred through negligence rather than wilfulness.’”
“The nature and severity of the sanction [for spoliation] depends upon a number of factors, including, but not limited to, the knowledge and intent of the spoliator, the existence of proof of an explanation for the loss of evidence, and the degree of prejudice to the opposing party.”
As the party seeking sanctions for spoliation, the defendants were required to demonstrate “that the party having control over the evidence possessed an obligation to preserve it at the time of its destruction, that the evidence was destroyed with a culpable state of mind, and that the destroyed evidence was relevant to the party’s claim … such that the trier of fact could find that the evidence would support that claim.” “A culpable state of mind for purposes of a spoliation sanction includes ordinary negligence.”
“Where the evidence is determined to have been intentionally or willfully destroyed, the relevancy of the destroyed [evidence] is presumed. On the other hand, if the evidence is determined to have been negligently destroyed, the party seeking exfoliation must establish that the destroyed [evidence was] relevant to the party’s claim or defense.”
[T]he defendants sustained their burden of establishing that the plaintiff was obligated to preserve the truck at the time it was purportedly “seized and disposed” of, that the truck had been seized and disposed of before the defendants had an opportunity to inspect it, and that the truck was relevant to the litigation. Furthermore, the defendants demonstrated that their ability to prove their defense had been significantly, if not fatally, compromised by the loss of the truck. Under the circumstances presented, the sanction of striking the complaint was appropriate.
Accordingly, the Supreme Court should have granted the defendants’ motion to strike the complaint.
Case Questions
Explain what happened to the Delmur truck.
Discuss why the lack of an inspection to the car is so critical to the case.
Does it matter that Delmur acted negligently, but not intentionally, in losing the truck?
Consider … 4.3
The obstruction of justice trial against the accounting firm of Arthur Andersen found the prosecution using the following types of evidence:
Testimony from partners, employees, and consultants with Andersen
E-mails among Andersen partners, employees, and consultants; both saved and deleted e-mails were introduced into evidence
A videotape of a partner making a presentation to employees on the pending SEC investigation in which he urged employees to get rid of excess files so that “nosy plaintiffs’ lawyers” wouldn’t be able to find damaging evidence
The statistics on the e-mail deletions by Andersen employees, including the peak in e-mail deletions following the presentation that was shown on video and the instruction to get rid of unnecessary files
The articles clipped and saved by Andersen employees relating to Enron and SEC investigations
What would the government need to show to establish that Andersen had engaged in spoliation through their e-mail deletions?
Ethical Issues
Evaluate ethics of the lawyer in Delmur case for not responding or not timely responding to the requests for access to the truck. Is that behavior different from lawyers discussing document destruction and “nosy lawyers”?

Limitations on Discovery
Discovery has the general limitation of relevance. Only things that are evidence or could lead to the discovery of evidence are discoverable. However, discovery also has a specific limitation. Discovery cannot require the production of work product, which consists of the attorney’s legal research, comments or reactions to a witness, thoughts, analysis, and case or trial strategy. Discovery affords the parties the right to know all the evidence (if it asks for it), but it does not give them the right to know how that evidence will be used or what legal precedent supports a party’s position.
Certain evidence in cases is not discoverable. Communications between lawyers and their clients is protected by a privilege and, except in certain limited circumstances, cannot be discovered or used by the opposition. (See Chapter 3 for a complete discussion of privilege.)
Cyberlaw and Discovery
Businesses are required to preserve their business records. Smartphones create problems because smartphones can be configured in different ways, sometimes with very limited archiving capability. In certain configurations, a message deleted can be lost forever. There are programs that permit hackers to download everything from a smartphone in about 30 seconds. There is a risk of everything from corporate espionage to the loss of privilege on documents that become public via hackers or theft.
Companies should develop policies on the use of smartphones by executives that cover the following:
Configuration of smartphones, access, and archiving. For example, the executive branch of the federal government has configured the smartphones of government officials so that the messages are archived (as required by law for government business) and then stored by a contractor who then manages and indexes the messages so that they are not lost.
The requirement of a password for access to the phone.
No sharing your passwords with others.
If your smartphone is lost, notify the IT staff immediately so that they can take protective and preventive action.
Topics that should and should not be discussed on social media and smartphones.
Discussion of risks of social media and smartphone communication.
Deletion of messages on smartphones.
Business Planning Tip
When in doubt, don’t. That is, if you have any question about litigation or an investigation, do not destroy e-mails, documents, or tangible evidence.
Every company should have a document retention and file purging policy. Employees should follow the timelines on retention and destruction. Even when the designated time for destruction has arrived, any doubt about pending litigation, investigations, or regulatory issues means the documents should be retained.
